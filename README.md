# SpringBoot-validation-ExceptionHandling

Exception ->  Exception is an abnormal condition.
            In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.

Validation using Hibernate Validator -> Hibernate validator offers validation annotations for Spring Boot that can be applied to the data fields within your Entity class, and allows you to follow specific rules and conditions for fields in which we are applying validators to meet your custom constraints. These annotations help ensure that the data meets all the conditions applied using the validators.
